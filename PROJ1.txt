Write-up for Proj 1
(1) (10 points) What is the name of the (user space) wrapper function of the system call for the
shutdown2 command (2 points)? Where is this wrapper function invoked (3 points)? Where
is this function defined (5 points)?


(2) (10 points) Explain (with the actual code) how the above wrapper function triggers the system
call.


(3) (10 points) Explain (with the actual code) how the OS kernel locates a system call and calls
it (i.e., the kernel-level operations of calling a system call).


(4) (10 points) How are arguments of a system call passed from user space to OS kernel?


mkdir2 (Jacob) - My implementation works as intended, creating two directories passed as arguments and
rejecting the arguments if they do not have a length of 2. The sys_mkdir2 function is reached through a 
wrapper routine. The function implements the code from sys_mkdir twice, using argstr(0, ...), retrieve the
first argument and argstr(1, ...) to retrieve the second argument. The main function of mkdir2.c was modified,
but only to add a newline character and exit when an incorrect number of arguments are passed.
