Write-up for Proj 1

mkdir2 (Jacob) - My implementation works as intended, creating two directories passed as arguments and
rejecting the arguments if they do not have a length of 2. The sys_mkdir2 function is reached through a 
wrapper routine. The function implements the code from sys_mkdir twice, using argstr(0, ...), retrieve the
first argument and argstr(1, ...) to retrieve the second argument. The main function of mkdir2.c was modified,
but only to add a newline character and exit when an incorrect number of arguments are passed.
